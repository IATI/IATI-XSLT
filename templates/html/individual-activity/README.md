## Individual Activity CSV with jQuery and google visualisations

This XSLT transformation takes the xml for an activity and generates a simple view of the key information it contains in plain HTML. The associated CSS file is used to lay-out the data, and the javascript makes use of (jQuery)[http://jquery.com/] and the (Google Chart tools)[http://code.google.com/apis/chart/] to turn tables into maps and charts. 

The included index.php can run the transformations in a PHP file, drawing upon the Aid Info Labs toolkit at http://tools.aidinfolabs.org
