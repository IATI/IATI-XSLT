These XSL templates can be used to produce human readable documentations tables
from an XML table. There is support for outputting as HTML, CSV and ODS. Most
of the parsing functionality is in base.xsl, but you should not call this
directly. Instead, use the schemaname-filetype.xsl template. E.g. for html
output of the iati actvities schema use iati-actvities-html.xsl

The ODS template produces only the content.xml part of an ODS file. To produce a .ods file, move this content.xml into the ods folder, and compress the contents of the folder into a zip file. Rename this file to give it a .ods file extension. 
e.g. on a unix-esque commandline:
    cp content.xml ods/
    cd ods 
    zip ../something.ods *.xml META-INF/*
