These XSL templates can be used to produce human readable documentations tables
from an XML table. There is support for outputting as HTML, CSV and ODS. Most
of the parsing functionality is in base.xsl, but you should not call this
directly. Instead, use the schemaname-filetype.xsl template. E.g. for html
output of the iati actvities schema use iati-actvities-html.xsl

The ODS template produces only the content.xml part of an ODS file.
