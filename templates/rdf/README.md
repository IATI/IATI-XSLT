## IATI as RDF

This is a first attempt at creating a rendering of IATI as linked data (in rdf/xml) using an XSLT conversion. 

You can test your XSLT modifications against live data on the IATI Explorer Toolkit at http://tools.aidinfolabs.org/exist/rest//db/iati?_query=//iati-activity&_xsl=https://raw.github.com/aidinfolabs/IATI-XSLT/master/templates/rdf/iati-activities-rdf.xsl
