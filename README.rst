IATI XSLT
=========

This repository has been set up to act as a library of XSLT transformations for working with IATI (International Aid Transparency Initiative) XML data. All are released under the MIT license, see `LICENSE <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-XSLT/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.

While these transformations are incredibly useful to those that have a use for them, we don't really use them much ourselves, and so we don't actively maintain them.

However...

If you have XSLT files for working with IATI data we would love to include them in this repository. Please fork the repository and send us a pull request!

You can find IATI data at https://www.iatiregistry.org.
